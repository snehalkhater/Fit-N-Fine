      <p>
        Cardio exercise, which is sometimes referred to as aerobic exercise, is any rhythmic activity
        that raises your heart rate into your target heart rate zone—such as boxing drills on a punching bag.
        This is the zone where you burn the most fat and calories.
        Some of the most common examples of cardio include walking, cycling, and swimming.
        However, even household chores like vacuuming and mopping qualify as cardio exercise.
        Part of what sets cardio apart from other types of exercise—such as strength training—is that
        it relies on your body's ability to use oxygen during the workout session.
        A person's cardio ability or capacity can vary based on a number of factors.

      <h3>How to Choose Cardio Workouts</h3>
      <p>
        Your first step in choosing the right cardio workout is to decide which activities you enjoy.
        Think about what fits your personality and movement you'd feel comfortable fitting into your life.
        This is key because if you don't like the exercise, you're less likely to stick with it long-term.
        Exploring nature, running, cycling, or walking—all great cardio options.
        If you prefer going to the gym, you have many options in the form of stationary bikes,
        elliptical trainers, treadmills, rowing machines, climbers, swimming pools, and more.
